## Project Intro.

**Random Survivor**。

Random Survivor (RS for short) is a metaverse built for survivors. Your on-chain behaviours would be the same as your real life to affect the rate of your survivor.

It is designed as a P2E chess game. Users can spend a small amount of money buying special NFTs to enter the game. Ultimately, the more you deposit, the more you win. Rewards would be airdropped to addresses based on the activity status.

In the follow-up Roadmap, we will gradually open other application scenarios of $RS Token, such as purchasing RS blind boxes and extracting NFTs with different attributes, so as to improve the survival rate and profitability in the game. Enter the secondary market to trade your rare NFTs, use $RS to participate in three rounds of Pre-Sale in Survivorvers Land, and use $RS to participate in other Survivorvers games, etc.
